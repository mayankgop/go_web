type Handler interface{
    SeverHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}

Request is of type struct which has fields like url , method , header , form , postform etc. 


any type which has the above method i.e. (ServerHTTP) is also of type Handler



type ServeMux
	func NewServeMux() *ServeMux
	
	func (mux *ServeMux) Handle(pattern string, h Handler)
	func (mux *ServeMux) HandleFunc(pattern string, h func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
	func (mux *ServeMux) Handler(r *Request) (h Handler, pattern string)
	func (mux *ServeMux) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
    
    type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)




ServeMux is a HTTP request multiplexer. 
It matches the url of each incoming rquest against a list of registerd patterns 
and calls the handler for the pattern that most closely matches the url

whenever we have a pointer to a ServeMux we can implement handler interface

function NewServeMux() gives return type as *ServeMux
