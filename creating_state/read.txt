we can pass data to server through url or through body

when we submit a form we use either post or get method

post sends form data to server through body
get sends form data to server through url


we can retrieve values using function :-----------
func(r *Request)FormValue(key string) string

FormValue returns the first  value for the named component of the query
if key ius not present then form value returns the empty string

when we make post request we have to encode the data that forms the body of request

html provides three methods of encoding:
1)application/x-www-form-urlencoded  (default way)
2)multipart/form-data
3)text/plain


redirect allows us to redirect a request from one locaton to another
redirects mean-
So client makes a request server and then that request is for a certain resource and then 
the server just redirects the client to another location.

status code-
http 301 : it permanently changes the location
http 303 : it asks the client to see other location and always chane the method to get
http 307 : it temporarily redirects and does not change the type of the method
